# 📈 Big-Data-Analysis-of-KOSPI

This project analyzes the **correlation between credit balance indicators in the capital market and the KOSPI index** using Python-based big data analytics.

> Analysis Period: From 2008  
> Targets: Daily KOSPI index, margin trading credit balance, secured loan balance  
> Technologies: Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## 📌 Objective

- Empirically analyze the **impact of margin trading activities** (e.g., credit loan, short selling) on the **KOSPI index**
- Evaluate **correlation and predictability** using regression and machine learning models

## 🔍 Analysis Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing**
   - Check for null values, normalize data, create new features
   - Correlation matrix among variables

2. **Visualization**
   - KOSPI trend over time
   - Scatter plots and correlation matrix

3. **Regression Analysis**
   - Simple Linear Regression (e.g., credit_long → KOSPI)
   - Multiple Linear Regression (e.g., lending + credit_long → KOSPI)
   - Model Evaluation: R², RMSE

4. **Machine Learning**
   - Gradient Descent-based regression using TensorFlow
   - Achieved high predictive performance without hyperparameter tuning

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- `credit_long` and `lending` have strong positive correlation with the KOSPI index (R² > 0.8)
- With multiple regression, test R² ≈ **0.80**, RMSE ≈ **126.8**
- Size of margin trading activities indicates strong investor sentiment, reflected in index movements
